# Tesla Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project applies deep learning techniques to analyze and predict Tesla (TSLA) stock prices using historical stock data. The focus is on building an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to capture temporal patterns in financial time series data.

---

## Files Included

- `Tesla.csv`: Historical stock price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume)
- `tesla_analysis_Code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data exploration, preprocessing, LSTM modeling, and evaluation
- `Tesla_Project_Report.docx`: Final report with theoretical background, visualizations, model discussion, and business implications

---

## Project Objective

To forecast Teslaâ€™s stock price using deep learning models (LSTM), and to evaluate its prediction accuracy for decision-making in financial analysis and investment strategy.

---

## Key Techniques Used

- Time series visualization and statistical analysis
- Moving averages and volatility trends
- LSTM modeling using TensorFlow/Keras
- Sequence windowing (60-day lookback)
- RMSE-based model evaluation

---

## Outcome

The LSTM model was able to identify sequential patterns in stock prices and produce forecasted values with reasonable accuracy. The project demonstrates the potential of deep learning for financial forecasting and risk management.
